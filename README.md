# Portfolio-Challenge-02

Portfolio

Created: index.html, style.css, reset.css

Copied reset.css from class activity 11.

# Description

Firstly I drew quick mock ups of each viewport design on paper. Then I created the HTML, CSS, and copied the reset.css from one of the class activies. I quickly found myself eager to complete this page! I love applying what I have learnt, and I have thoroughly enjoyed applying myself to this assignment. I spent a lot of time googling different terms and questions. Things like making sure I use semantic HTML, and additionaly I also learnt things like flex-basis and applied them to the page. I was self teaching and followed a few "front end mentor" free designs - these are linked as my projects. Thanks for checking this out :) Vanessa.
